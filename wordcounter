# Since I'm not using Word it can be annoying to count the number of words in the project
# This file counts the number of words in specified source files and adds them up, then echos the section and total counts
# Since it's counting the source files it isn't perfect - syntax used for layout for instance will be counted
# Ideally we'd count the number of words in the pdf but this is enough
