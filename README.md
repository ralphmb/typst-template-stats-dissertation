## My Stats Dissertation

This is the template I made for my final year project in Maths and Stats.
The code used for generating headers was written by Jacopo Zagoli, [and comes from this repo](https://github.com/zagoli/simple-typst-thesis).
I think I've changed it a bit but it's still almost entirely their work, used under the Apache license, thank you to them as I'd not have been able to figure the headers out myself.


The rest is mine. I've removed most of the content except one plot and one reference.
Feel free to reuse anything if you can find a use for it.

I use a software called Typst, it's like LaTeX but using markdown-esque syntax.

The Typst documentation can be found at [["https://typst.app/docs/reference/"]], and Reddit/Discord/Stackoverflow can answer most questions about this markup language.

The actual thesis is in writeup/main.typ. If you install typst and compile this using `typst compile main.typ` you'll generate a pdf like 'main.pdf'.
I also used Typst for the presentation. This is found in presentation/pres.typ. It uses a package called Polylux.

Thanks!
